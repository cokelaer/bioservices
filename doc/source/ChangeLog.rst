Revision 1.3
------------------



* 1.3.6
  * BUG FIXES
    * KEGG: Fixed during the major changes described here below
            https://github.com/cokelaer/bioservices/issues/29
  * CHANGES
    * IntactL rename Intact class into IntactComplex
    * KEGG: revisited the parsing following requests from user
      https://github.com/cokelaer/bioservices/issues/30
    * KEGG: remove useless function (check_dbentries) 
    * KEGG: The KEGGParser does not inherit from KEGG anymore and there is
            now a parse() method inside KEGG so user do not need to play with the 
            2 classes. Only KEGG is required. KEGGParser can still be used but
            will not have the KEGG methods anymore

* 1.3.5

    * quickgo: fix bug https://github.com/cokelaer/bioservices/issues/22

  * NEWS

    * add PRIDE service + test + doc

* 1.3.3

  * BUG FIX
     * uniprot fixing a python 3 typo

  * CHANGES
    * pdb: add a method
    * hgnc: add new class related to HGNC

  * NEWS 
    * services.py: add a method to ease conversion of dict to json. add
      attribute to limit number of requests per seconds but not yet used.
    * taxonomy module: add new method in Taxon to look for a taxon identifier given a name
    * NEW module ensembl completed
    * NEW module clinvitae added (contribution from Patrick Short)

* 1.3.2

  * CHANGES:

    * services: http_get and http_post now accepts all optional arguments from requests.
    * services: get_headers default content is now same as urrlib2
    * pdb module: more functions added
    * ensembl module added with some functionalities

* 1.3.1

  * CHANGES:

    * uniprot: multi_mapping is deprecated. mapping can now handle long queries by itself.
    * services/settings:

      * removed get_bioservices_env function, which is not used anymore
      * move urlencode in Service class into WSDLService, which will be deprecated
      * add TIMEOUT in WSDLService and REST as alias to settings.TIMEOUT so timeout
        can now be used in both REST and WSDL.

  * NEWS:

    * readseq module added. 

  * BUG fixes: 

    * CACHING attribute had a typo

* 1.3.0

  * NEWS

    * added REST class that uses the requests module. This class replaces
      of instance of RESTservice that uses urllib2, which will be deprecated
      later on. This speeds up the code significantly not only 
      because requests is faster but also because we now do not need trial/time
      hack that was implemented inside RESTService. We also use the 
      requests_cache module that could be used to speed go but requires
      to store cache files locally. Asynchronous requests is available but used
      only in a few places for now. 
    * EUtils has been fully implemented excepting EPost. API may still change to
      make its usage easier but functionalities are there.

  * CHANGES

    * update code to be python-3 compatible. There are still issues with suds/requests/gevent
      but the code itself is python3 executable.
    * WSDLservice now uses suds instead of SOAP package by default
    * all paramters called format have been renamed frmt (format is a python
      keyword)
    * chembldb module and class renamed to chembl and :class:`bioservices.chembl.ChEMBL`
    * All classes that depends on RESTService have been updated to use the new
      REST class.
    * chembldb: 

      * get_assay_by_chemblId renamed in get_assays_by_chemblId
      * renamed  get_target_by_refSeqId into get_target_by_refseq
      * kegg module: all Kegg strings replaced by KEGG so the kegg.Kegg class is
        now kegg.KEGG
    * ChEBI:  getUpdatedPolymer: remove useless parameters (was failing with python3)
    * Wikipathway class renamed as WikiPathways to agree with official name
    * biomart now uses python3 and we had to remove the threaded_request module,
      which does not seem to ba available. So, we used the new implementation
      using requests but gevent is not available for python3 either so, we use
      requests but without the asynchronous call. This is working for now.
      Transparent for the user.
    * geneprof: parameter called type and format are renamed output and frmt to
      not clash with python keywords. Use REST class instead of RESTService but
      should be transparent for the users.
    * services do not have the checkParam method. use
      devtools.check_param_in_list instead.

  * BUG FIXES:

    * Fixing bug #24/25 posted on assembla related to parse_kgml_pathway
      second argument can now be used. 
    * wikipathway: findInteractions had a typo in i
