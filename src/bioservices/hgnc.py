    .. highlights::

        "The HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) has assigned unique gene symbols and
        names to over 37,000 human loci, of which around 19,000 are protein coding.
        genenames.org is a curated online repository of HGNC-approved gene nomenclature
        and associated resources including links to genomic, proteomic and phenotypic
        information, as well as dedicated gene family pages."
